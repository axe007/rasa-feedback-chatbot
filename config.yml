# NLU pipeline configuration
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer  # Tokenizes text based on whitespace
  - name: RegexFeaturizer  # Extracts features using regular expressions
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer  # Extracts lexical and syntactic features
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer  # Converts text to count vectors
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer  # Converts text to character-based count vectors
    analyzer: "char_wb"
    min_ngram: 1
    max_ngram: 4
  - name: DIETClassifier  # Dual Intent Entity Transformer for intent classification and entity recognition
    epochs: 150
  - name: FallbackClassifier  # Classifier to handle fallback when confidence is low
    threshold: 0.7
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper  # Maps synonyms to the same entity
  - name: SpacyNLP  # SpaCy model for NLP processing
    model: "en_core_web_md"
    case_sensitive: false
  - name: "SpacyEntityExtractor"  # Extracts entities using SpaCy model
    # Note: It is not possible to use the SpacyTokenizer + SpacyFeaturizer in
    #       combination with the WhitespaceTokenizer, and as a result the
    #       PERSON extraction by Spacy is not very robust.
    #       Because of this, the nlu training data is annotated as well, and the
    #       DIETClassifier will also extract PERSON entities .
